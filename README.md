# LightDx.DirectX11Tutorials
This repository provides DirectX 11 Tutorial (http://rastertek.com/tutdx11.html) ported to C# and LightDx.

Although LightDx has a simple API, I believe it'll be helpful to provide more examples. You can easily 
find how to use the library here. 

However this is not a real DX11 tutorial, so
* Only selected tutorials are provided.
* Some of the code may be slightly different from the original tutorial.

## What's in each project?

* [Tutorial04](Tutorial04)
  * Initialize the device.
  * Use vertex/index/constant buffer.
  * Draw 3D objects with matrix algorithm.
  * Respond to window resize event.
  
* [Tutorial07](Tutorial07)
  * Use depth buffer in the render target.
  * Load and use Texture (DDS).
  * Calculate elapsed time.
  
* [Tutorial21](Tutorial21)
  * Use multiple constant buffers.
  * Use multiple texture resources.
